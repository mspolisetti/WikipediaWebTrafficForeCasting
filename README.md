#  Wikipedia Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting

*Problem Statement:* Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free encyclopedia with openly editable and viewable content. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the web. It is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that operates on money it receives from donors.

Our current project focuses on the problem of forecasting future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles.

*Data:* The training dataset consists of approximately 145k time series. Each of these time series represent a number of daily views of a different Wikipedia article, starting from July, 1st, 2015 up until December 31st, 2016. 

(Since this dataset is huge we might start with exploring single time series (One page) and extend it to explore working with multiple time series. )
